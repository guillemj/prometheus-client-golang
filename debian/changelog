golang-prometheus-client (0.3.0+ds-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, which includes an incompatible change in metric
    fingerprints, so invalidates all past storage. This is not a problem yet,
    because prometheus is still not uploaded to Debian.
  * debian/patches: Refresh, remove unneeded patch.
  * Upstream now vendors all dependencies: remove the ones already in Debian.
  * New patch: Fix import path for remaining vendored dependencies.
  * Update watchfile for repackaging mangle.
