Description: Prometheus instrumentation library for Go applications
 This is the Prometheus Go client library. It provides two main functions:
 .
 * The exposition library is used to export metrics to a Prometheus server or
   pushgateway.
 .
 * The consumption library is used to process metrics exported by a Prometheus
   client. (The Prometheus server is using that library.)
